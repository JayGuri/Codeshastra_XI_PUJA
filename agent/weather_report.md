## Rome Travel Report - April 5, 2025

### Overview

This report provides essential travel information for a day trip to Rome on April 5, 2025, for travelers from India.  Due to the short duration of the trip, the focus will be on maximizing the experience within a single day.

### 1. Visa Requirements
